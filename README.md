# Note-Finder
Produces an interactive display of a guitar-like fretboard



Development Plan
1. Finish UI components: switches between scale and single highlight, and which scale to highlight if true
2. Add basic CSS styling
4. Add in UI for instrument toggle
5. Clean up and refactor code where necessary



VERSION 2
1. Implement Node.js
2. Separate scale variable assignment data into MySQL or separate file
3. Add a "sticky-note" feature on click - hovered value will stick when clicked, unstick on click
4. Create a dynamic instrument feature - add or remove strings
5. Fix scale-highlight limitations - will break if anything changes positional placements (tuning)



EVENTUAL TO-DO'S:
1. Dynamic limit-setting: need to figure out a way to dynamically set min/max values in loop
    - considering changing the way I find scales
    - try finding values via a flat array vs. 2d [A, B, C, D,.....]

2. Dynamic fretboard generation: need to figure out a way to dynamically set strings via user input
    - standard tuning means the next string will begin on value[colIndex + 6]

3. Being able to set different tunings won't work properly until #1 and #2 are solved
